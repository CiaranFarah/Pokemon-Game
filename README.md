# Pokemon-Game

This project is just a fun Pokemon 2 player game I made using PyGame to learn how to use the library. The game is designed to be played on the same computer with the person controlling Tyranitar using WASD to move with Q to shoot, and the player using Blaziken can move using the arrow keys and the right shift button to shoot. The game ends when one player has their health bar completely depleted, upon which the game will close after a brief delay.
